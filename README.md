Welcome to the Breez Github page, we are a team of developers working on a transpiler for kOS. 
Breez will be used in many places like [Saturn Aerospace](https://www.youtube.com/c/SaturnAerospaceKSP), personal projects and other virtual space companies.

If you'd like to start programming rockets with Breez, then [**download it**](Installation.md)!

## What Is Breez?

Breez is a [transpiler](https://medium.com/madfish-solutions/what-is-a-transpiler-47beac592848) which can be used to transform the code to [Kerboscript](http://ksp-kos.github.io/KOS_DOC).
You can use Breez to program rockets in KSP, and then run it through the kOS mod after compiling the code through Yamal (name for our compiler).
 We describe it as: *a stripped down version of Kerboscript that makes syntax more lightweight and also makes kOS more user/programmer friendly.*

## What is different?
Due to kOS being very [verbose](https://www.bing.com/search?q=verbose+meaning&cvid=7604b27f4fa7431c90ec9d1e17405cb4&pglt=171&FORM=ANNTA1&PC=U531), we have taken away all of the
useless parts and shortened it all down. 
For example, if you were to be declaring a variable in kOS, it would look like this:

```bash
set variable to 0.
```

However with Breez you only need to write this:

```js
variable => 0;
```

This makes the code more like more common programming languages like Python or JavaScript, however there are many different bits from other popular languages.

If you'd like to find out more, then wait until we've finished the actual thing!
